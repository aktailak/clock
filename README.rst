Welcome to Clock
================

Clock is a nice datetime practice.

It should be easy to use and support web applications.

Guideline
---------

**Always handle time in UTC.**

Installation
------------

::
    
    $ pip install clock

Usage
-----

::
    
    import clock

    # Internally always use UTC, convert everything else to UTC
    pass
    
    # Interfacing with the user, convert to local time
    pass

    # utcnow and timedelta
    pass
